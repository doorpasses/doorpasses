## Shared Packages

All applications share code through workspace packages located in `packages/`:

- **@repo/ui**: Shared UI components (shadcn/ui based)
- **@repo/prisma**: Database schema and Prisma client
- **@repo/email**: Email templates and utilities
- **@repo/integrations**: Third-party integrations
- **@repo/notifications**: Notification configurations
- **@repo/background-jobs**: Shared job definitions
- **@repo/config**: Shared configuration (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)
- **@repo/types**: Shared TypeScript types
- **@repo/validation**: Shared Zod schemas

## Monorepo Architecture

The Epic Stack uses a monorepo structure with the following benefits:

1. **Code Sharing**: Common components, utilities, and configurations are shared across applications
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types are shared, ensuring consistency across the stack
3. **Unified Tooling**: Linting, formatting, and testing tools are consistent across all apps
4. **Atomic Changes**: Changes to shared code can be made atomically across all consuming applications
5. **Efficient Builds**: Only changed applications and their dependencies are rebuilt

## Getting Started

To work on any application:

1. **Install dependencies** (from root):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the relevant app directory
   - Fill in required values

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/[app-name]
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run multiple apps simultaneously** (from root):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Port Reference

| Application | Port | URL |
|------------|------|-----|
| Main App | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 |
| Admin | 3001 | http://localhost:3001 |
| Web (Marketing) | 3002 | http://localhost:3002 |
| Prisma Studio | 3003 | http://localhost:3003 |
